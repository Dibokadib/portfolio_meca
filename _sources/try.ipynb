    "# What is an inverse problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical models and data play a big role in modern science and engineering. The field of inverse problems bridges these two and studies if and how one can infer model parameters from relevant observations. A prominent example is the famous black hole image, shown in {numref}`blackhole`, that was constructed by merging data from various telescopes {cite}`akiyama`.\n",

    "A prominent subfield of inverse problems is that of imaging, with applications in chemistry, biology, geosciences, and medicine. Various methods for imaging have been developed over the previous four decades and have been partly made available for practical use. What sets many of these imaging modalities aside from conventional photography is that the raw data is not interpretable as an image directly. Instead, significant processing using mathematical models is required to obtain a useable image. Next, we give a few examples.\n",

    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Images are of great importance in many applications, ranging from microscopy, medicine, to astronomy. In all these applications, the recorded images are distorted or corrupted versions of the ideal image. The inverse problem consists of reconstructing the idealized image from the measured one.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of a (digital) image as a two dimensional array of pixels where each element could, for example, represent the grey value of the corresponding pixel. A color image could be represented by a tensor containing the RGB intensities for each pixel. Alternatively, we can think of an idealized image as a (vector-valued) function on a bounded domain (say, the unit square).\n",
    "\n",
    "A mathematical model for the observed image should model the process by which the image was obtained. This often involves [convolving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution) the image with a filter and adding noise. For example, for a digital image with pixel values $u_{i}$, the measured image can in many cases be modeled as\n",

    "\n",
    "$i = (i_1,i_2)$ and $j = (j_1,j_2)$ are [multi-indices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-index_notation) and $k: \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is the filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Representing the image as a function $u : \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, we may have\n",

    "f(x) = \\int_{\\Omega} k(x-y)u(y)\\mathrm{d}y,\n",

    "\n",
    "The resulting inverse problem is to undo the convolution. In some cases, $k$ may not be known perfectly, in which case it is called *blind deconvolution*. Other image-related inverse problems include *denoising*, where a noisy version of the image is measured, and *inpainting*, where a significant part of the pixels are missing. Some examples are shown below."

    "### Variational methods\n",
    "Variational methods are a popular and quite generally applicable technique for solving inverse problems. The idea is to replace the original equation $K(u) = f$ by a minimization problem. To do this, one constructs an optimization problem with a functional consisting of two terms. The first part is the data fidelity and is supposed to ensure that $K(u) \\approx f$.\n",
    "The second part is the regularization functional which incorporates the a-priori information on $u$. Thereby, we obtain a problem of the form\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where further a-priori information on the class of images $u$, over which we minimize, can be contained, e.g. non-negativity for density images. The data fidelity term $D$ should be constructed in such a way, that $D$ attains its minimum (often normalized at zero) if the data are reconstructed exactly. The regularization functional should be constructed in such a way, that $R$ attains a small value if the image matches the a-priori information very well, and a very large value, if the image does not fit to the available a-priori information. As a result, such images will be unlikely to minimize the functional. The parameter $\\alpha$ weights the two parts of the functional. For very small $\\alpha$ the emphasis lies on fitting the data, whereas with increasing $\\alpha$ the regularization gains in importance in this ratio, which is particularly essential if measurement errors or noise can be expected.\n",
